We eat at Todai in Pacific Place regularly. After a long run, nothing refuels you like sushi! The sushi is fresh and ready to go. While it isn't as charming as a sit down Japanese restaurant where a sushi chef presents the meal in an artistic fashion, the savings is worth it.

The sashimi was not fresh at all, and had food poisoning that night, and had to attend a conference the next day.  Do not go to any of the Todai restaurants.
