Eggplant parm sauce tasted burnt. waitress took it back. I didn't want anything else (espically with a burnt taste in my mouth)-charged me 1/2 for the meal. will not go back there to eat.

Great place in the downtown area of toms river.  I thought they have good prices and great food.  The only thing that needs inprovement where you enter in to the restaurant, there is no room, too crowded!

Food lacking in quality, Overrated, overpriced - a Caesar salad at $5.95 was more than half rusty lettuce, dressing  & croutons ok.  Not a nice experience.
