We've now eaten at the Homestead maybe five times.  It is totally surprising to find a restaurant of this quality in Huntsville.  You would expect something this fine in Houston, but Huntsville?  Everything we've tried has been fantastic.  Do not come if you are in a big rush, but this is the perfect way to spend a relaxing evening of dining.  They will never try to rush you or hurry you along.  It's a great place to eat, drink, and talk with friends.

We've been here 3 times. Everytime we stay at the Parker Hoouse B&B We come here. The food is first class and the atmosphere relaxed and peaceful. Was never rushed and the service was outstanding. Have had amny items on the menu and everything has been fantastic. Highly recommended.

This restaurant was wonderful! We travel every week to this place, which has a very home-like atmosphere. We immediately felt comfortable and welcome. We all recommend the specials, they have been outstanding.

The food was excellent. We enjoyed the finest dining experience that Huntsville has to offer. The steak was tender and its taste was fabulous. The sauteed mushrooms are best I have ever had. This is an upscale restaurant in a town known for its fast food eateries. Best time to dine is Friday and Saturday as usually there is musical entertainment. Highly recommended!!!!
