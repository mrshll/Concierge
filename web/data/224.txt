The owner was especially pleasant to talk with and was very dedicated to ensuring he was making authentic Louisiana food.  The meal was OUTSTANDING!  I had gumbo, my wife roast beef sandwich.  We were both very pleased with the atmosphere and the food. Gumbo was just like home, except without the squirrel meat.

These guys have the best customer service there is.  Be prepared for friendly conversation and a true Cajun experience.  Not to mention, they have the best peanut butter pie in the country.  Thanks for such a great experience!

Great food - wonderful flavor. We took it to go and had some great wine with it. The person who served us gave very good descriptions of the various dishes to help us make a decision - even though we wanted some of everything.

We were greeted with enthusiasm and the food was fantastic. I was not completely familiar wth cajun food so I asked quite a bit of questions. All were answered thouroughly and with excitement. The food was served with a wide variety of sauces from mild to scorned woman hot souce! Woo Baby! That stuff is great! It's a very casual place and the kids absolutely love it.
