Best place to eat in nebraska! The food was great, and so was the service! I would go back in a hearbeat! I couldn't believe how great the prime rib was.

Made a reservation but still had to wait 1 1/2 hrs to get a table. My husband did not get the kind of potato he ordered, told waitress and she never fixed the problem. Both our steaks were overdone. Waitress said she couldn't do anything about it.
