We are picky and this place is great. Good old fashion country cooking. Nothing fancy. Good place to take a family. Comfortable. Food like Grandma used to make.

This is the dirtiest place i have ever set foot into. You could not pay me enough to eat here again! The food was gross, the servers were rude! Just plain right nasty!
