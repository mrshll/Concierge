The best restaurant ever, anywhere!  There is no comparison to bugaboo!  Everything on the menu is simply beyond expectations!  Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise...

My boyfriend of five and a half years, Jai, and I go to Bugaboo all of the time!!! It is our favorite restaurant. Even if you don't like steak, they have great chicken, and fix too!!! Not to mention the entire building is filled with wild animals, and a singing bison. What a great experience. Try it, you will love it.
