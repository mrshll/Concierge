Great food, great service! I dine there quite regularly.  I've never ever had a credit card issue.  Love the huge portions!   I have recommended to all my friends and co-workers.

WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD CHARGE.  THEY MORE THAN DOUBLED MY AUTHORIZED TIP AMOUNT WHICH WAS OVER 15%.

First of all the buffalo wings are the best I have ever had in a restaurant.  Very tasty and big.  Get plenty of great food for a great price.  A steak eaters heaven.
