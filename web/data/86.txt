Wait staff highly knowledgable. Recommended wines which complemented the many dishes our party ordered. Our waiter did not even use a notepad!! He remembered everything without fail. The food was fresh, delicious, authentic and came very quickly. WOW!! What impresses me the most is that the restaurant and lounge appeared to be very very busy and everyone was happy and enjoying themselves. REMARKABLE. We love the area and as soon as we get back we most certainly will return to the Black Forest.

My husband and I have eaten here several times. We have always received EXCELLENT service  (Rodger) and the food is great (We aways order Fillet Oscar-You can cut it with your fork). I would highly recommend this place for a great night out. They are now offering live music on Fri. and Sat. nights and we have enjoyed our visits each and every time.
